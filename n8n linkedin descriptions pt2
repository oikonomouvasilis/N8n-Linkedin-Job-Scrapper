  •	Job evaluation: Here, we use an AI agent that performs a comparison between the candidate’s profile, their resume, and the job posting. This process requires:
1)  An input prompt describing the goal of the comparison. 2) A selected AI model (e.g., ChatGPT 5.0). 3) A structured output parser, which provides instructions on how to extract and format the results in JSON form.
  •	If: A logical operator that checks the candidate’s compatibility score with the specific job. If the score is greater than 3.5/5, the process proceeds to Stage 3. Otherwise, it simply updates the sheet with the job’s evaluation score.
